Objective:
The purpose of this project is to implement and assess a Path ORAM (Oblivious RAM) storage system.  
The experiment examines how the stash size behaves over a large number of operations, for two configurations with bucket sizes Z=2 and Z=4.  
From this data, we estimate the probability P[size(S) > R].
